Meeting notes 4/4/24 
- Project concept: cost of travel between FCC and the on-ramp of I-270
- FCC is a single entrance, I-270 is a single exit
- many alternate routes with different distances, traffic distributions,
- Delegated tasks:
  - Minh: queueing system, multiqueue implementation; road lane simulation
  - Michael: navigation; real-world representation & data
  - Dean: clock; event system(?)
  - Marshal: dijkstra's algorithm demo, + contained implementation


4/10/24
-create base simulation that can be tweaked with buses, hov, tolls & think of other means of improving travel time
-create individual test classes to test functionality of code snippets

4/17/24
-track passenger destinations for comparing bus routes vs car
-consider alternative solutions to reducing traffic
