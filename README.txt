4/24/24
-get fully functional project to prepare for presentation
-people score
-establish span of simulation in terms of nodes/locations, add real data to replace placeholders
-copy constructor

4/17/24
-track passenger destinations for comparing bus routes vs car
-consider alternative solutions to reducing traffic

4/10/24
-create base simulation that can be tweaked with buses, hov, tolls & think of other means of improving travel time
-create individual test classes to test functionality of code snippets

4/4/24 
- Project concept: cost of travel between FCC and the on-ramp of I-270
- FCC is a single entrance, I-270 is a single exit
- many alternate routes with different distances, traffic distributions,
- Delegated tasks:
  - Minh: queueing system, multiqueue implementation; road lane simulation
  - Michael: navigation; real-world representation & data
  - Dean: clock; event system(?)
  - Marshal: dijkstra's algorithm demo, + contained implementation

5/6/24
Presentation Notes:
- Add link to the information source
  - Enlarge diagram and make it more coherent (less specific detail)
- Clock
  - First bullet wording
    - Measures time for each car
  - Add simple diagram of queues
- Event Setter
  - Timeline diagram
  - Add actual text
- Results
  - Examples of runs for busses of varying amounts vs. no busses
  - Graph of Time Traveled to # of Busses
- Improvements
  - Clarify about variables our simulation can't account for
- Summary
  - Create summary slide
  - What we learned
  - What the data showed
  - "Questions?"
- Overall
  - Increase text size
