- Project concept: cost of travel between FCC and the on-ramp of I-270
- FCC is a single entrance, I-270 is a single exit
- many alternate routes with different distances, traffic distributions,
- Delegated tasks:
  - Minh: queueing system, multiqueue implementation; road lane simulation
  - Michael: navigation; real-world representation & data
  - Dean: clock; event system(?)
  - Marshal: dijkstra's algorithm demo, + contained implementation
